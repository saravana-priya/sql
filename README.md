# 📊 E-commerce Sales Analytics with BigQuery

An end-to-end SQL-based data analytics project using Google BigQuery, built on the `thelook_ecommerce` public dataset. This project demonstrates core data engineering and analytics skills — from raw data exploration to dimensional modeling, KPI reporting, geospatial analysis, window function logic, and Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) handling.

## 🔍 Key Features

### ✅ 1. Data Exploration
- Monthly revenue trends
- Top-selling products
- Customer acquisition (new vs returning)

### ✅ 2. Data Modeling
- Created dimension and fact tables using clean SQL logic
- Built star schema and a fully denormalized reporting table

### ✅ 3. Business KPIs
- Total revenue, order volume, AOV, CLTV
- Sales by category, region, and product
- New vs returning customer trends

### ✅ 4. Geospatial Analytics
- Revenue by customer proximity to NYC or SF
- Sales distribution by city/state
- Worked with BigQuery `GEOGRAPHY` data and `ST_DISTANCE`

### ✅ 5. Advanced SQL (Window Functions)
- `RANK()` for top products by category
- `ROW_NUMBER()` for first transaction each day
- `LAG()` and `LEAD()` for year-over-year sales comparison

### ✅ 6. Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2)
- Implemented SCD Type 2 on product dimension to track historical changes
- Used `MERGE` statements and `valid_from`, `valid_to`, `is_current` fields
- Enables historical versioning of data for accurate time-based reporting
